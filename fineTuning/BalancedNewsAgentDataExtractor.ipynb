(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) As Democrats push to restore Roe this election, Donald Trump says states should decide abortion laws BY Reena Diamante Texas PUBLISHED 6:36 PM CT Oct. 09, 2024 PUBLISHED 6:36 PM CDT Oct. 09, 2024 SHARE WASHINGTON \\u2014 Former first lady Melania Trump appears to be taking a different stance than her husband when it comes to abortion rights. In a video posted on social media last week, Melania Trump expressed her support for women\\u2019s \\u201cindividual freedom.\\u201d Abortion access is a key issue in this presidential election and one that has become politically harder for former President Donald Trump to navigate after his Supreme Court appointees allowed for the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Spectrum News previously examined where Vice President Kamala Harris stands on abortion rights , and this follow-up report looks at Trump's take. What You Need To Know Former President Donald Trump said he has no regrets over appointing the three justices that created the Supreme Court majority to overturn the constitutional right to an abortion At one point, Trump suggested he would support a federal 15-week abortion restriction, but he has since reversed course, saying abortion law should be left up to the states Some health law experts say it remains unclear where Trump stands exactly on issues such as access to contraception or medication abortion and the distribution of such drugs in the mail and those experts also point to proposals from Trump allies that could impact access President Joe Biden reversed Trump's rules that barred organizations that provide abortion referrals from receiving federal family planning money, but health policy experts expect if Trump is elected he would put those rules back in place Trump used to say he supported abortion rights, but in 2016, he campaigned on nominating justices that would overturn Roe v. Wade. When he was elected, that was exactly what he did. Those three appointees created the majority that ended the constitutional right to an abortion. Trump said he has no regrets. \\u201cI\\u2019m just happy that we had Supreme Court justices that had the courage to do that,\\u201d Trump said at a campaign rally in Mosinee, Wisconsin. The end of Roe means accessing abortion depends on where you live. Trump said he personally believes there should be certain exceptions that go beyond what\\u2019s allowed in some states like Texas. \\u201cI believe in the exceptions for rape, incest and life of the mother. I believe strongly in it,\\u201d Trump said at the September presidential debate against Harris. At one point, Trump suggested he would support a federal 15-week abortion restriction. \\u201cThe number of weeks, now, people are agreeing on 15, and I\\u2019m thinking in terms of that,\\u201d Trump said in a radio interview in March with \\u201cSid & Friends in the Morning.\\u201d Trump has since reversed course, saying abortion law should be left up to the states. In a Truth Social post on October 1st, Trump wrote \\u201cEVERYONE KNOWS I WOULD NOT SUPPORT A FEDERAL ABORTION BAN, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, AND WOULD, IN FACT, VETO IT.\\u201d \\u201cIt is now where it always had to be with the states and a vote of the people,\\u201d Trump said at a rally at Indiana, Pennsylvania, on Sept. 23. In vitro fertilization became a big political issue this year after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. Trump vowed to protect IVF. \\u201cUnder the Trump administration, your government will pay for or your insurance company will be mandated to pay for all costs associated with IVF treatment, fertilization for women,\\u201d Trump said in August at a campaign rally at Potterville, Michigan. But Trump has not said how the plan would work or be paid for. \\u201cThat is something that generally would require the involvement and support of Congress. That isn\\u2019t something you know, that isn\\u2019t something that a president can do individually, that would require federal legislation,\\u201d said Usha Ranji, the associate director for women\\u2019s health policy, KFF, a health policy research and news organization. Some health law experts say it remains unclear where Trump stands exactly on issues such as access to contraception or medication abortion and the distribution of such drugs in the mail. Those experts also point to proposals from Trump allies that could impact access. \\u201cHe doesn\\u2019t want to say, \\u2018I will absolutely sign an abortion ban.\\u2019 He doesn\\u2019t have to, right? But if he appoints someone who is completely pro-life to the FDA, and he appoints someone who is completely, you know, pro-life, even to the Veterans Administration, right, it can impact what our veterans have access to,\\u201d said Carliss Chapman, associate professor of law at Southern Methodist University. During his first term, Trump barred organizations that provide abortion referrals from receiving federal family planning money. \\u201cEven though the federal dollars have never been used for abortion care, they\\u2019re used purely for family planning care, (Trump) put a rule in that prohibited that. As a result, the network of clinics that was participating in the program really shrunk,\\u201d Ranji said. President Joe Biden reversed those changes, but health policy experts expect if Trump is elected, he would put those rules back in place.

I'veSeenFootage Feb. 25 07:38 am JST He did not present evidence for his claims. Of course he didn't. Because, as always, he has none and is lying through his teeth. But fortunately, his ignorant supporters don't need evidence or facts, they just need to be perpetually angry. 11 ( +15 / -4 ) Jimizo Feb. 25 07:42 am JST He did not present evidence for his claims You don\\u2019t say. 10 ( +14 / -4 ) Ah_so Feb. 25 07:53 am JST The chaos continues.... But this should not be seen as a surprise, but we need to keep asking ourselves how these emotionally stunted fools got their hands on the levers of power. 8 ( +12 / -4 ) Underworld Feb. 25 08:02 am JST \\u201cWhat he\\u2019s doing is saying, \\u2018Are you actually working?\\u2019\\u201d And what I would say to Musk is \\u201care you working?\\u201d Because I don\\u2019t see a lot of planning and documentation. I don\\u2019t see any consultation. I see a few too many obvious mistakes, that if you took care of what you are doing, wouldn\\u2019t happen. Musk needs to make improvements, and soon. Otherwise, I would recommend termination of him and his team. 4 ( +7 / -3 ) theFu Feb. 25 08:04 am JST Department of Government Efficiency has found \\u201chundreds of billions of dollars in fraud\\\" as he suggested that federal paychecks are going to nonexistent employees. He did not present evidence for his claims. Complete B.S., like all the other \\\"fraud claims\\\" made by Musk and Trump. I know how to save $8M/day - fire Musk. All the other firings will likely need to be rehired and Congress will for back-pay to be paid to them for the mental stress because it will be cheaper than all the court cases. There were a bunch of really dumb American voters last fall. The sad thing is that some still don't see it when they look in the mirror. 5 ( +10 / -5 ) Peter Neil Feb. 25 08:05 am JST the lies continue. state department and defense department civilian employees (and other agencies) emailed everyone to ignore musk\\u2019s email. in even more lies, trump fools said they are not moving forward with a $400 million contract to make armored tesla cyber trucks for the state department, supposedly done by biden. well, the actual amount was $480,000 for a pilot program to test some light electric vehicles. more musk lies about saving money. pathological liars lying with more lies. 5 ( +9 / -4 ) Peter Neil Feb. 25 08:09 am JST here\\u2019s a way to save taxpayers $120 million per year, half a billion in 4 years: make trump fly his own plane to play golf. 9 ( +13 / -4 ) virusrex Feb. 25 08:10 am JST One positive thing about this debacle is that it has become obvious that the current government acted way too quickly in their destructive goals, which means lots of people that were fooled into supporting them are now clearly understanding how big of a mistake it was. The main part of the frog in the boiling pot analogy was that things happened in a slow gradient, but seeing how town halls are responding, this was done ineptly and people are reacting. 4 ( +9 / -5 ) patkim Feb. 25 08:22 am JST Musk is only there to fire workers from agencies that have been investigating his companies. That way, he can still make loads of money selling inadequate vehicles. That's the only reason he wants to continue to support Trump. Trump in turn can get paid tons of money from Musk to pay off any legal fees. Trump is also there to keep himself from going to jail. That's it. They don't care one bit for the American people, unless they are among the very wealthy. 8 ( +11 / -3 ) Peter Neil Feb. 25 08:24 am JST most people resist saying they were fooled or made a mistake. in truth, they knew exactly what they voted for. trump told his cult what he was going to do. in no universe could anyone say that they didn\\u2019t know. 9 ( +12 / -3 ) KnightsOfCydonia Feb. 25 08:29 am JST I\\u2019m sure these institutions have some form of performance review system in place and if not, could implement one. This kind of showboating is purely for the cameras and has no real substance to it. I\\u2019m sure there is a lot of fat that can be trimmed and deadweight that can be dropped but it doesn\\u2019t need to be some kind of \\u201c reality show drama\\u201d. 8 ( +9 / -1 ) stormcrow Feb. 25 08:31 am JST Gotta give those millionaires and billionaires a trillion dollars in tax cuts. Let's do it off the backs of the middle class! 7 ( +9 / -2 ) itsonlyrocknroll Feb. 25 08:32 am JST The photo is a truly remarkable uncanny Musk achieving a separated at birth spittern resemblance of French President Macron. Ai has no limits. Elon Musk role is defines as a \\\"special government employee,\\\" a rather vague opaque advisor function Congress created (1960s) allowing federal government to \\u201cask special advisers\\\" to contribute to a specific role. Only on a temporary basis. However the parameters of such a role allows Musk need not have to divest his businesses interests. Can anyone not see a clear conflict-of-interest? A clear example is the meeting between Musk and Narendra Modi prime minister of India, I ask quite fairly is Musk truly representing Trump administration or as the CEO of Tesla? Elon Musk should not be heading, or have any direct decision making role in Department of Government Efficiency. -1 ( +2 / -3 ) I'veSeenFootage Feb. 25 08:41 am JST I\\u2019m sure these institutions have some form of performance review system in place Of course they do. They are of course not without problems, as all instutions of that scale are, but they are only full of fraud and moochers in the mind of the MAGA-addled. 8 ( +9 / -1 ) HopeSpringsEternal Feb. 25 08:45 am JST US in fiscal death spiral. Only second term President can realistically enact MUCH needed restructuring and downsizing. DOGE = digital audit's perfectly legal, as EVERY Pres. uses outside experts not confirmed by Senate. Without US Govt. downsizing, soon debt service will consume the entire budget, meaning no discretionary spending and serious nondiscretionary cuts. As Musk says, downsizing is NOT optional/see above -13 ( +3 / -16 ) HopeSpringsEternal Feb. 25 08:51 am JST Downsized Govt. workers will receive severance and will end up producing more value in private sector, helping overall economy continue to grow without inflationary pressures. All Organizations experience reorganizations, US Govt. LONG Overdue Govt. clearly full of fraud, waste and abuse, and as regulations are reduced, there is less need for workers to enforce such burdensome and expensive regulations.

Copy Facebook X Truth Gettr LinkedIn Telegram Email Save Elon Musk in Washington on Nov. 13, 2024. Andrew Harnik/Getty Images By Austin Alonzo 12/6/2024 Updated: 12/7/2024 Print X 1 0:00 According to new financial disclosures, in a late-cycle push, Elon Musk edged out Timothy Mellon as the largest individual donor to politicians seeking federal office in 2024. On Dec. 5, federal committees registered with the Federal Election Commission issued their so-called post-general reports covering their financial activities from Oct. 17 through Nov. 25. The filings showed Musk, who has gained a position of high influence in President-elect Donald Trump\\u2019s circle, donated more than $238.5 million to a super political action committee backing Trump\\u2019s candidacy for the White House in 2024. That total put Musk ahead of Mellon, an heir to the Mellon family fortune, who was a major donor to the Make America Great Again Inc. super PAC. MAGA Inc. was a prominent ally of Trump in his run for office. Mellon also sponsored a group supporting Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\\u2019s independent candidacy, American Values 2024, in 2023 and 2024. Mellon contributed about $197 million in the 2023\\u20132024 election cycle, according to the Money in Politics watchdog organization OpenSecrets. Musk founded the super PAC America PAC, according to its website. The organization\\u2019s main goals are strong borders, safe cities, free speech, sensible spending, a fair justice system, and self-protection. According to its most recent FEC filing, America PAC spent more than $249.9 million in 2024. Independent expenditure reports attached to the Dec. 5 filing said America PAC spent its money on printing, postage, phone calls, text messages, digital media, canvassing, and field operations largely to boost Trump and oppose the Democratic Party\\u2019s candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris. Smaller expenditures were directed toward helping Republicans in races for the House and Senate. Related Stories Musk, Ramaswamy Meet With Top Republicans on Capitol Hill 12/5/2024 With DOGE, Musk, Ramaswamy Confront the \\u2018Immovable Object\\u2019 12/5/2024 Musk and the PAC attracted considerable media attention by giving away $1 million per day to registered voters who signed a petition supporting free speech and the right to bear arms in the run-up to the election. The $1 million check promotion also drew attention from both the U.S. Department of Justice and Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, who attempted to block the gifts by accusing the PAC of running an illegal lottery. That effort was ultimately blocked on Nov. 4 by a judge from the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas. In November, Musk vowed to continue the PAC\\u2019s political activities in the coming midterm elections and direct its resources toward smaller local races. Musk is believed to be among the wealthiest men in the world. Forbes estimates his worth at more than $347 billion. He is the founder and CEO of Tesla Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. Since the Nov. 5 federal election, Musk has spent much time in Trump\\u2019s transitional government organization and is reportedly speaking with foreign leaders and weighing in on cabinet picks. Musk, along with fellow Trump ally Vivek Ramaswamy, is leading a nongovernmental advisory group called the Department of Government Efficiency, which aims to slash federal spending. In addition to his support of America PAC, Musk donated to three other groups in 2024\\u2014the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), the Calvert Victory Fund, and the Early Vote Action PAC, according to FEC records. The NRCC is a group dedicated to electing Republicans to the House. The Calvert Victory Fund was a group devoted to reelecting Rep. Ken Calvert (R-Calif.). The Early Vote Action PAC, according to its most recent FEC filing, paid various individuals for \\u201cfield strategy consulting.\\u201d Additionally, a group registered to a PO Box in Austin, Texas, called the \\u201cElon Musk Revocable Trust,\\u201d sent $20.5 million to the super PAC RBG PAC on Oct. 24, according to federal records. According to its independent expenditure reports, the group supported Trump.
